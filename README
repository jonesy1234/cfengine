If your like me and want to create a really slick configuration to manage your servers
then cfengine is the tool of your dreams. I won't start going on about it here but just
go to the following to get an idea of how it can help you become the ultimate sysadmin!

http://www.cfengine.org/

Start off with the community edition and pay for it if you start using it all the time as
you get more features! I wish every company had a community and a enterprise edition!

Anyway this collection here is some bundles of promises/polices that I've been working on 
and improving over the last 6 months of using cfengine. It's not provided as a working
configuration, only posted on git to help any newbies that are giving it a crack.

Cheers
Steve.
